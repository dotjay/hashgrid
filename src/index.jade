      h2#usage Usage

      p The document must have keyboard focus for #grid to work. You may need to click on the document background or <span class="key">TAB</span> into the page first.

      dl
        dt <span class="key">g</span>
        dd Show the grid until you release.
        dt <span class="key">g</span> + <span class="key">h</span>
        dd Show and hold the grid (<span class="key">g</span> will remove it again).
        dt <span class="key">g</span> + <span class="key">f</span>
        dd Toggle the grid to the foreground and back. Pressing <span class="key">f</span> while the grid is held also works.
        dt <span class="key">g</span> + <span class="key">j</span>
        dd Jump to the next grid. Pressing <span class="key">j</span> while the grid is held also works.

      p <em>N.B. Hashgrid remembers the state of the grid when you refresh the page. While the grid is in front, you will not be able to interact with the page except in Chrome v4, Safari v4, Firefox v3.6, or more recent versions.</em>

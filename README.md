A little tool that inserts a layout grid in web pages, allows you to hold it in place, and toggle between displaying it in the foreground or background.

## Features ##

 * Adaptable for all layout widths and alignments
 * Adaptable for any vertical rhythm value
 * Set keyboard shortcuts to show and hide the grid, hold it in place, toggle it to the foreground and background, and jump between multiple grids
 * Uses a single JavaScript file and a little CSS to control the grid lines, columns and gutters
